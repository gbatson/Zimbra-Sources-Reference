/**
 * Plugin interface. Plugins enhance the functionality of Wildfire. They can:<ul>
 *
 *      <li>Act as {@link org.xmpp.component.Component Components} to implement
 *      additional features in the XMPP protocol.
 *      <li>Dynamically modify the admin console.
 *      <li>Use the Wildfire API to add new functionality to the server.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Plugins live in the <tt>plugins</tt> directory of <tt>home</tt>. Plugins
 * that are packaged as JAR files will be automatically expanded into directories. A
 * plugin directory should have the following structure:
 *
 * <pre>[pluginDir]
 *    |-- plugin.xml
 *    |-- classes/
 *    |-- lib/</pre>
 *
 * The <tt>classes</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directory are optional. Any files in the
 * <tt>classes</tt> directory will be added to the classpath of the plugin, as well
 * as any JAR files in the <tt>lib</tt> directory. The <tt>plugin.xml</tt> file is
 * required, and specifies the className of the Plugin implementation. The XML file
 * should resemble the following XML:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
 * &lt;plugin&gt;
 *     &lt;class&gt;org.example.YourPlugin&lt;/class&gt;
 *     &lt;name&gt;Example Plugin&lt;/name&gt;
 *     &lt;description&gt;This is an example plugin.&lt;/description&gt;
 *     &lt;author&gt;Foo Inc.&lt;/author&gt;
 *     &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;
 *     &lt;minServerVersion&gt;3.0.0&lt;/minServerVersion&gt;
 *     &lt;licenseType&gt;gpl&lt;/licenseType&gt;
 * &lt;/plugin&gt;</pre>
 * <p/>
 * Each plugin will be loaded in its own class loader, unless the plugin is configured
 * with a parent plugin.<p/>
 *
 * Please see the Plugin Developer Guide (available with the
 * Wildfire documentation) for additional details about plugin development.
