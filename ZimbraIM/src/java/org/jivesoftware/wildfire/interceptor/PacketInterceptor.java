/**
 * A packet interceptor encapsulates an action that is invoked on a packet immediately
 * before or after it was received by a SocketReader and also when the packet is about to
 * be sent in SocketConnection. These types of actions fall into two broad categories:<ul>
 *      <li> Interceptors that reject the packet by throwing an exception (only when the packet
 *            has not been processed yet).
 *      <li> Interceptors that dynamically transform the packet content.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Any number of interceptors can be installed and removed at run-time. They can be installed
 * globally or per-user. Global interceptors are run first, followed by any that are installed
 * for the username.<p>

     * Invokes the interceptor on the specified packet. The interceptor can either modify
     * the packet, or throw a PacketRejectedException to block it from being sent or processed
     * (when read).<p>
     *
     * An exception can only be thrown when <tt>processed</tt> is false which means that the read
     * packet has not been processed yet or the packet was not sent yet. If the exception is thrown
     * with a "read" packet then the sender of the packet will receive an answer with an error. But
     * if the exception is thrown with a "sent" packet then nothing will happen.<p>
     *
     * Note that for each packet, every interceptor will be called twice: once before processing
     * is complete (<tt>processing==true</tt>) and once after processing is complete. Typically,
     * an interceptor will want to ignore one or the other case.
     *
     * @param packet the packet to take action on.
     * @param session the session that received or is sending the packet.
     * @param incoming flag that indicates if the packet was read by the server or sent from
     *      the server.
     * @param processed flag that indicates if the action (read/send) was performed. (PRE vs. POST).
     * @throws PacketRejectedException if the packet should be prevented from being processed.
