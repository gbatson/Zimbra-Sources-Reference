/**
 * Provider for authorization. Unlike the AbstractAuthorizationPolicy
 * class, this is intended for classes that need a more "heavyweight" 
 * solution, often that requires consulting some storage or external
 * entity about each specific case.  This class allows individual mappings
 * between authenticated principals and usernames, and if the storage
 * mechanism allows it, management of those mappings.
 *
 * Users that wish to integrate with their own authorization 
 * system must extend this class and implement the 
 * AuthorizationProvider interface then register the class
 * with Wildfire in the <tt>wildfire.xml</tt> file. An entry 
 * in that file would look like the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;provider&gt;
 *     &lt;authorizationpolicy&gt;
 *       &lt;classlist&gt;com.foo.auth.CustomPolicyProvider&lt;/classlist&gt;
 *     &lt;/authorizationpolicy&gt;
 *   &lt;/provider&gt;</pre>
