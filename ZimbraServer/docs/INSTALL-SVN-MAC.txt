=== Download from SVN ===

https://zimbra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zimbra
Accept certificate

At the bare minimum, you will need the ZimbraServer folder and its immediate dependencies
However, feel free to checkout all of the projects you think might be relevant

=== Setup /opt/zimbra ===

Open a terminal shell and run the following commands:

<pre>
% sudo su -
% mkdir -p /opt/zimbra
% chown {user_name}:{user_name} /opt/zimbra
% exit
</pre>

=== Install MySQL ===

Download and install from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html

This doc was prepared with 5.0.27 and is known to work with that version of MySQL

Note: Install *both* packages so that MySQL will automatically start
when you boot.

Run the following commands:

<pre>
% sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql /opt/zimbra/mysql
</pre>

Then edit the file /opt/zimbra/mysql/data/my.cnf, type in the
following, and save:

<pre>
[mysqld]
bind-address = localhost
port = 7306
</pre>

Now you should be able to start MySQL with the following command:
[Note: you may have to reboot in order for this to work]

<pre>
% sudo SystemStarter start MySQL
% mysql -u root -p
</pre>

When the Password: prompt pops up press Enter and then execute this command

<pre>
mysql>SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('zimbra');
</pre>

Note: For the ant scripts to build correctly, you must use zimbra as your password

=== Install OpenLDAP ===
The version of BerkeleyDB that comes with Mac OS X client is not sufficient for
OpenLDAP. As a result, you will need to install the latest version of BerkeleyDB
which can be found at this website:

http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/index.html

This documentation was prepared with version 4.5.20

Download the latest version of OpenLDAP from http://www.openldap.org/software/download/

This documenation was prepared with version 2.3.32

Extract the openldap-*.tar.gz file into /opt/zimbra

Make sure to properly configure and install the OpenLDAP software
To configure OpenLDAP use the following command:
  env CPPFLAGS="-I{path/to/install}/BerkeleyDB/include" \
      LDFLAGS="-L{path/to/install}/BerkeleyDB/lib" ./configure --prefix=/opt/zimbra/openldap-{version number]

Run the following command:

<pre>
% ln -s /opt/zimbra/{openldap_configure_path} /opt/zimbra/openldap
</pre>

Then run the set of commands
<pre>
sudo su -
visudo
</pre>

And add the following at the end of the file and save:
<pre>
%{user_name}{TAB}ALL=(ALL){TAB}NOPASSWD:ALL
<pre>

Finally run the command
<pre>
exit
</pre>

=== Install Ant ===

Download from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

This documentation is using version 1.6.5

Extract the .tar.gz file to someplace useful and add to your
PATH.

=== Install Tomcat ===

Download from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi

This documentation is using version 5.5.17

Extract the .tar.gz file into /opt/zimbra/ and run the following
commands

<pre>
% ln -s /opt/zimbra/{tomcat_extract_dir} /opt/zimbra/tomcat
% cd {workspace_location}/ZimbraServer/
% cp conf/tomcat-5.5/* /opt/zimbra/tomcat/conf/
</pre>

=== Deploy Zimbra ===

Deploy Zimbra with the following commands:

<pre>
% su sudo -
% cd {workspace}/ZimbraServer
% ant reset-the-world-stage1
% touch /opt/zimbra/redolog/redo.log
% chown {username}:{username} /opt/zimbra/redolog/redo.log
% /opt/zimbra/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start
% ant reset-the-world-stage2
</pre>

If you added the views needed for web client development in
the Subversion step above, you can now deploy the application
with the following commands:

<pre>
% cd {workspace}/ZimbraWebServer
% ant deploy
</pre>

You should now be able to point your browser to the following
URL and login with the username "user1" and password "test123":

<pre>
http://localhost:7070/zimbra/
</pre>
