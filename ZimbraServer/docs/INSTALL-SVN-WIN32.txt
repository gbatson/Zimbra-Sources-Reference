0. Before starting please make sure that you have a valid environment setup. JAVA_HOME should
   be defined in your environment variables. To do this:
   1) Right click on My Computer and go to Properties
   2) Click on the Advanced Tab and then click Envirnment Variables
   3) Click New under User variables for ...
   4) Add JAVA_HOME and the path above the bin directory of your JDK

1. Install the IDE of choice, but this documentation used Eclipse

2. Checkout the following from Subversion at https://zimbra.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zimbra:

   ZimbraCommon - holds the jars for the projects

   ZimbraIM - required for ZimbraServer

   ZimbraServer - the backend system

   ZimbraWebClient - the dhtml interface

   Ajax - DTML/Ajax toolkit

   Optional: ThirdParty - not needed to run, but has javadocs and
   source for the various 3rd party jars/servers. It's very very large
   since all the built servers and 3rd Party code (multiple versions)
   are in there.

3. Install Tomcat 5.5.x

   On Windows, install Tomcat to c:\opt\zimbra\tomcat after downloading the 5.5.x version
   from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi. This documentation used 5.5.20

   copy ZimbraServer/conf/tomcat-5.5/server.xml to c:\opt\zimbra\tomcat\conf\
   copy ZimbraServer/conf/tomcat-5.5/tomcat-users.xml c:\opt\zimbra\tomcat\conf\

   The server.xml file is configured to use port 7070 by
   default. Production would of course use 80, and we'll also need to
   configure SSL

   The ZimbraServer/build.xml relies on a zimbra/zimbra user in the
   tomcat-users.xml file to deploy

   Now start the Tomcat Server

6. Install the latest version of MySQL.

   On Windows, install MySQL to c:\opt\zimbra\mysql

   Install it to run on port 7306

   We expect for now an admin account of "root" with password
   "zimbra".  The ZimbraServer/build.xml file relies on the root account
   to create the zimbra database and user/pass.

7. Install OpenLDAP

   Download http://download.bergmans.us/openldap/

   This documentation used version 2.2.29

   On Windows, install to c:\opt\zimbra\openldap. During the install
   make sure to check "install OpenLDAP-slapd as NT Service"

   The location of the schema files changed in OpenLDAP 2.2.29.
   If you're using 2.2.29 or later, you'll have to manually edit
   slapd.win.conf in the ZimbraServer/conf/ldap folder and change
   the paths to the schema files from /opt/zimbra/openldap/etc/schema
   to /opt/zimbra/openldap/schema except for the amavisd.schema file
   and the zimbra.schema lines.

9. Initialize system

	From inside Eclipse on the Java Perspective select:

  	Window -> Show View -> Ant

  	Add: ZimbraServer/build.xml
  		Run the "reset-the-world" target.
  	This will wipe out parts of /opt/zimbra, reload the database,
  	and inject the sample messages.

  	Add: ZimbraWebClient/build.xml
    	Run "deploy" and "admin-deploy"

    This will compile/deploy the DHTML interface and the Admin Console.

    If you install ant standalone, you can also run "ant
    reset-the-world" from within the ZimbraServer root directory.

10. Test deployment

    You should now be able to go to:

        http://localhost:7070/zimbra/

    and login as "user1[@{hostname}]" (the domain is optional), with
    password "test123", where {hostname} is the name of your local
    machine.

    You can log into the Admin Console by going to:

        https://localhost:7071/zimbraAdmin

    and login as "admin@{hostname}" (the domain is mandatory), with
    the password "test123", where {hostname} is the name of your local
    machine.
