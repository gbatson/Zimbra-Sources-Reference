To get the ZCS touch client running locally, follow the steps below.

1. Sync with Perforce. It should create the following directories:

	Project directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t
	App directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t/app
	SDK directory: .../main/ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/t/touch

2. Deploy as normal. Everything under /t should get copied into the deploy
area under /opt/zimbra/jetty/webapps/zimbra.

3. Login by going to:

	http://localhost:7070/?client=touch&breakpoint

If you're on an actual iPad, you don't need to include the 'client' parameter. You can
also use the iOS Simulator that comes with xCode.

To see your local build on an iPad, put your laptop on wireless and then find its IP by
running 'ifconfig -a'. The IP will normally start with '192.68'. On your iPad, use Safari
to go to

	http://192.68.x.y:7070
