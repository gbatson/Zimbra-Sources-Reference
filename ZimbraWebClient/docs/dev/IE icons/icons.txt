This documentation is in reference to bug 75630 (http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=75630).

With IE 10, Microsoft dropped support for DX filters. Zimbra used the DX filters to allow users to customize the color
of icons (e.g. tags, folders, calendars, etc).  For browsers other than IE, Zimbra uses the Canvas tag for this 
customization. However, as of Zimbra 8, the AJAx application is rendered using quirks mode which prevents the AJAX
client for using Canvas or SVG to manipulate the color of the icons.  

The approach to support IE 10 in Zimbra 8 is to generate all combinations of the icons which can be customized.  There
are 15 icons with 59 possible color variations.  To generate these icons, we have a HTML web page which uses the same
canvas methods in the non-IE browsers to generate the icons.  The data-uri that is generated is then POSTed to a PHP page
and saved to a file.

1. Install the php processing script

####PHP Script#####
Mac OS ships with an Apache webserver and PHP installed.  You just need to enable it.
* Edit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf so the PHP module is loaded:
LoadModule php5_module libexec/apache2/libphp5.so

* Restart the web server
sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart

* Save the following as /Librar/WebServer/Documents/processing.php
<?
$data = substr($_POST['imageData'], strpos($_POST['imageData'], ",") + 1);
$imageName = $_POST['imageName'];
$decodedData = base64_decode($data);
file_put_contents("/tmp/custom/".$imageName.".png", $decodedData);
?>
 
* Give /tmp/custom/ directory the required permissions
chown _www /tmp/custom
chmod 755 /tmp/custom

Once you access that ImageGenerator.html the /tmp/custom directory populate with the images.

--------------------------------------

2. Setup ImageGenerator.html
#####JavaScript######
* Copy ImageGenerator.html to the public directory of Zimbra so it can be accessed via
http://localhost:7070/public/ImageGenerator.html

--------------------------------------

3. Run ImageGenerator.html
http://localhost/public/ImageGenerator.html

Once in the page, wait: it should display the generated images in the page once done.
Then look in /tmp/custom for the created images


If you get a 403 'Permission Denied' error (you can run the ImageGenerator.html with a
debugger to see the console output), set:
  zmprov mc default +zimbraProxyAllowedDomains localhost
to allow the zimbra jetty server to access you local Mac host.

If the images are not generated, click on one of the calls to processing.php and click
on the reply - it may have an error/warning that is informitive.

--------------------------------------

4. Once you have these 886 files, you can place them ZimbraWebClient/WebRoot/img/ie-custom-icons.

5. Next, run ant clean deploy from ZimbraWebClient
This will generate a ie-custom-icons.png sprite image and also add the required CSS classes to images.css.

6. Copy the ie-custom-icons.png into the /img/ie-custom-icons directory and remove the previously generated icons.
7.Copy the CSS classes from images.css that reference ie-custom-icons.png into a CSS file ie-custom-icons.css.




We conditionally load the ie-custom-icons.css stylesheet for IE9 user agents (in Zimbra 8 we force IE10 into IE9 browser
mode so detection is done as IE9).


This script has only been tested with Chrome on Mac.
